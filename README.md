Started to build a webpage to practise Essential consepts lerned. 
When I started this this project I did not know ES 6. It came to a stage where there was so many outdated consept on how to structure the website that it has become a "legacy" prosject. It was a great learning prosject. And a lot of different consepts was learned building this website. 

as of 11 December 2017. I will lay it rest in its GitHub grave. RIP
