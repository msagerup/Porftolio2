Started to build a web page to practise Essential concepts learned. When I started this this project I did not know ES6 and other modern consepts as WebPack and SCSS. It came to a stage where there was so many outdated concepts on how to structure the website  and outdadted production setup that it has become a "legacy" project.

It was a great learning project. And a lot of different concepts was learned building this website. as of 11 December 2017. I will lay it rest in its GitHub grave. RIP
